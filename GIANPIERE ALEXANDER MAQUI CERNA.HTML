  <h2>Some things about me:</h2>
<p>This is my first time using html or any programming language. I'm using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">THIS PAGE</a> to make this work. 
I studied at <a href="https://www.trilce.edu.pe/colegio">Trilce</a> and after finished it, I went to <a href="https://admision.unmsm.edu.pe/portal/">San Marcos academy</a> to apply for <a href="https://www.unmsm.edu.pe/">USNMSM</a> but also I studied at <a href="https://pitagoras.edu.pe/academia/">Pitagoras academy</a> for two month, just to know how they worked. <br/>After I tried it I couldn't enter <a href="https://www.unmsm.edu.pe/">USNMSM</a>  and I opted for other options and finally I'm studying here in  <a href="https://descubre.usil.edu.pe/pregrado/admision?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=dqtm-2021-2&utm_content=brand-admision&gclid=CjwKCAjwwqaGBhBKEiwAMk-FtCIa8dNpDipYaolM_GkW00Tn_sonX6yGYrFXSxC6AECbcXch0sSQ4BoCwjIQAvD_BwE">USIL</a> while I take english classes at <a href="https://www.icpna.edu.pe/">ICPNA.</a> 
  <h3> Things I would like to learn: </h3>
  <ul>
     <li>Of course, I would like to <b>learn computer science</b> (<a href="https://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/what-computer-science">what is computer science?</a>).In each class I motivate myself to learn more, although two months ago I was unaware of this whole world.</li>
     <li>Along with this course, I would also like to <b>learn to cook</b> at the level of <a href="https://trulyexperiences.com/blog/most-decorated-michelin-star-chefs/#Jordi-Cruz-5-Michelin-stars">the greatest in the world</a>, to be able to cook for my family. </li>
     <li>Learn more languages, especially <b>japanese</b> and thus finally visit <a href="https://www.travellens.co/best-things-to-do-in-akihabara/">Akihabara</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      
   <p> <b>Some social networks I use: </b>  <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/?lang=es">whatsapp</a>,  <a href="https://es-la.facebook.com/">facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=es-la">instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=es">twitter</a> and <a href="https://web.telegram.org/z/">telegram</a>.

   <h4> <b> Finally, </b> </h4>
